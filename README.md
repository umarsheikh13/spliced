# Spliced

Spliced is a minimal yet feature rich Tumblr theme that splits in half as you scroll down like if a ninja sliced it in half. It's fully responsive and works on all devices and all the major browsers.

## Mobile-ready:

The theme is responsive so it can be viewed on mobile/tablet devices. To activate the mobile version of this theme go to Customize > Advanced options and turn off the "Use default mobile theme" option.

## Full screen header image:

Please use an image with dimensions 1920px (width) by 1200px (height) otherwise the ninja slice won't work.

## Retina logo:

Please use an image with dimensions 256px (width) by 256px (height).

## Google fonts:

Go to google.com/fonts and choose any font you want to use. Once you've selected the fonts you want to use, type it in the fields "Font one" and "Font two" under "Customize". For example if you want to use the font "Open Sans" you would type in "Open Sans" exactly (without the quotes).
